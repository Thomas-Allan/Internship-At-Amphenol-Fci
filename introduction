This report provides a comprehensive overview of our internship experience at FCI OEN Connectors Ltd, Mulanthuruthy, Ernakulam for a period of 10 days from 09/07/2023 to 13/07/2023. 
The internship offered a valuable opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the professional-grade connectors manufacturing process, understand industry standards, and apply theoretical
knowledge to real-world scenarios.FCI OEN Connectors Ltd. is one of the country's major suppliers of professional-grade connectors. The company is a joint venture with 
FCI (earlier called Framatome Connectors France). It was incorporated on the 2nd day of June 1981.
Located far away from the madding crowds of the city of Cochin in Kerala, on the outskirts of Mulanthuruthy, atop a hillock aptly named Electrogiri, the company commands a calm and peaceful milieu.

Industry Overview 

The electronic cable connector industry plays a pivotal role in modern technology, facilitating the interconnection of various electronic devices. Connectors are used in a wide range of applications,
including consumer electronics, automotive, telecommunications, aerospace, and industrial automation. Understanding the industry's dynamics and challenges was crucial for our internship.

Internship Objectives

The primary objectives of my internship were:
 To familiarize myself with the various stages of Connectors manufacturing.
 To gain insights into quality control measures and industry standards.
 To understand the role of technology and innovation in the professional-grade connectors manufacturing industry.

Internship Experience 
1. Manufacturing Processes:
 Stamping: We observed the manufacturing process which is used to form metal sheets into desired shapes by applying pressure through a die. This process is widely used in various industries,
 including automotive, aerospace, electronics, and construction. Molding: We observed the injection molding process, where plastic connectors are formed by injecting molten material into a mold.
 I learned about the importance of mold design and process parameters in achieving high-quality products. Electroplating: We observed the electroplating process that uses electric current to drive
 a non-spontaneous chemical reaction. This process involves passing a direct current through an electrolytic solution (a substance containing ions) to decompose it into its constituent elements or compounds.
 Assembly: We observed the assembly of connectors, understanding the critical steps involved in connecting pins, contacts, and housings. I also learned about automated assembly techniques to improve efficiency.

2. Testing and Validation:

Environmental Testing: We observed the testing of connectors under various environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, humidity, and vibration. 
This ensured their suitability for different applications.

Performance Testing: We observed in testing the electrical and mechanical performance of connectors to verify their compliance with specifications.

Key Learnings and Insights 

Technological Advancements: We witnessed the latest advancements in connector design and manufacturing, including the use of advanced materials and automation technologies.
Industry Standards: We gained a deeper understanding of industry standards and certifications, such as IEC, UL, and RoHS, which are essential for ensuring product safety and compliance.
Supply Chain Management: We learned about the importance of efficient supply chain management in procuring raw materials, managing inventory, and delivering products on time.
Problem-Solving and Innovation: We developed problem-solving skills by identifying and addressing manufacturing challenges. We also gained insights into the innovation process in the connector industry.
